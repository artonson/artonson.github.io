## Oktaaf

Oktaaf is the brainchild of Spanish jewelry designer Ainoa Corres and Belgian internet entrepreneur Karel De Beule.
Ainoa and Karel carefully select small historical artefacts, to integrate them into wearable, contemporary jewelry.



### AI Cufflinks

One of the most astonishing objects in the entire collection of jewelry pieces designed by Oktaaf is undoubtedly a pair of cufflinks created with the help of artificial intelligence.
Natalia and Alexey helped them come up with an shape for this breakthrough idea. 


Karel and Ainoa created a mood board to start the process.

Two titanium screws from the Apollo 15 mission (1971) served as the inspiration.

The screws will accomodate one cufflink each.

### Generative AI for Shape Inspiration

The idea of the 3D shape of the cufflink should come from an Artificial Intelligence system. 
Technically, the type of AI algorithms used to synthesize 3D objects is called the _generative AI_. 
We have trained our generative AI neural network to model shapes from our [ABC dataset](/publications/2019-abc-dataset). 
This collection of shapes is so rich that it can serve as a base for generalization to a wide variety of 3D objects, encompassing various shapes and geni.

Ainoa has hand-picked a particular shape to serve as an inspiration for further work.

First AI-inspired conceptual sketches, where Ainoa is still in the process of figuring out the most suitable shape.

Hand-sketched shape in projections, with emerging sense of physical sizes.

First 3D sketches made by hand, giving a stronger feel of the shape of the final piece.

Selection of the suitable color combination that complements the gray titanium bolts with a vivid cherry glass finish.

The manufacturing process for the cufflinks includes selecting the closest matching glass color.
