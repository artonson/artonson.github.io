abstract: 'We present a multi-sensor dataset for multi-view 3D surface reconstruction. It includes 
  registered RGB and depth data from 7 sensors of different resolutions and modalities (a): smartphones, 
  Intel RealSense, Microsoft Kinect, industrial cameras, and structured-light scanner. The scenes are 
  selected to emphasize a diverse set of material properties challenging for existing algorithms (c), 
  such as featureless (F), highly specular with sharp reflections (S), or translucent (T), as illustrated with
  reconstructions produced by state-of-the-art algorithms (compare with an “easy” object on the bottom right).
  We provide around 1.4 million images of 107 different scenes acquired from 100 viewing directions under 14 lighting
  conditions (b). We expect our dataset will be useful for evaluation and training of 3D reconstruction algorithms and for related tasks.'
