# Alexey Artemov 

Hi! I am Alexey, a postdoc researcher at [TUM Visual Computing Lab](https://niessnerlab.org). Previously to joining TUM, I was a researcher at CDISE [Skoltech](http://www.skoltech.ru), advised by Associate Professor [Evgeny Burnaev](https://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/evgenyburnaev) and Adjunct Professor [Denis Zorin](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~dzorin/). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2017 from Institute for Systems Analysis of Russian Academy of Sciences ([ISA RAS](http://www.isa.ru/index.php?lang=en)) under the supervision of Evgeny Burnaev.
Prior to joining Skoltech, I was a research engineer at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/dev/), the Moscow-based internet giant, where I developed software systems for web search, computer vision, and [autonomous driving](https://sdg.yandex.com).
See more in [my CV](/cv_alexey_artemov.pdf).


My research interests include 3D scene and shape reconstruction and digital geometry processing, where I work on improving the geometry processing pipeline with deep learning accelerated algorithms. 
In 2021, I was honoured to receive the [Ilya Segalovich Award](https://yandex.com/company/blog/third-ilya-segalovich-award-honors-new-winners) for academic advisors.
